#gulp-dotenv-to-json
A dead-simple gulp plugin to write some of your dotenv into a json file that can be then used by your front-end application. Very handy if, for instance, you need to pass the server's env to your json but want to hide very secret credentials such as api keys from your client-served javascript. This plugin was originally made to partially share a dotenv between laravel and vuejs.


##Usage

Npm install the thingy :

    npm install gulp-dotenv-to-json;

Do something like this in your gulpfile.js. Use case : I only want to copy the 'SERVER', key of my dotenv to the json. If you want to copy your whole dotenv you can always put keys : ['*'];

    var dotenvToJson = require ('gulp-dotenv-to-json');
    gulp.task('dotenvToJson', function(){
        dotenvToJson.copy({
            keys : ['SERVER'],
            paths : {
                env : '.env',
                jenv : 'env3.json'
            }
        });
    });

Using elixir ? put the code above in your gulpfile and then :

    elixir(function(mix) {
        mix.task('dotenvToJson');
    }
